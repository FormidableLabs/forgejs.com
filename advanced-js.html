    <h1>Advanced JavaScript Intensive Weekend</h1>

    <p> Every significant web application today has major components written in JavaScript. Moving from jQuery and DOM manipulation to full scale application development has a steep learning curve. We're here to help.</p> 

     <p>Over the course of one evening and two days, you will learn skills and concepts foundational to building full stack JavaScript applications under the guidance of world class mentors. The focus of the weekend will be hands on, project-based learning designed to prepare you to work independently afterwards.</p>

    <p><b>Class size is limited to 24 attendees.</b></p>

    <h2>Am I prepared for the weekend?</h2>

    <p>You will be best served if you have a base level of experience with the JavaScript language. At a minimum, this means fluency with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data types</li>
      <li>Conditionals</li>
      <li>Functions</li>
      <li>Objects, properties &amp; methods</li>
      <li>Iterators</li>
      <li>jQuery API for DOM manipulation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you aren't already at this level or are not sure what some of the above terms mean, we would recommend waiting to attend a ForgeJS event and starting with some of these online resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">A re-introduction to JavaScript</a>
      <li><a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript">Code School</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Course Outline</h2>

    <p>The core of the Advanced JavaScript weekend is understanding critical design patterns that enable large scale JavaScript applications. The course proceeds with a series of projects into which the concepts and skills are integrated. The core topics are:</p>

    <h3>Higher Order JavaScript</h3>
    <p>We will ensure that you've mastered scoping, binding, understand how to treat functions as objects and generate new functions from within a function. We will also cover several of the ways that classes and inheritence have been implemented in JavaScript and ensure that you can take full advantage of it's prototypal nature regardless of what framework or platform you work within.</p>

    <h3>Mastering Asynchronous JavaScript</h3>
    <p>Working with asynchronous code can quickly become a mind bending excercise. You'll learn how to best use jQuery's Deffered and promises, and how to asynchronously process lists with the async library.</p>

    <h3>Event Driven Architecture</h3>
    <p>Regardless of what framework or platform you work with, events are the glue that allow your code to scale. Move beyond basic DOM events with an overview of custom DOM events, and event APIs as implemented by several popular frameworks. You'll learn how and when to use your own non DOM events to allow your objects and classes to communicate with each other.</p>

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <p>All ForgeJS courses have a review of, and emphasis on utilizing the best practices for version control and unit testing. In addition you'll have the opportunity to collaborate with small teams on your projects if you choose, but are welcome to work on your own. <b>You are also welcome to work through your own real world projects with our mentors.</b></p>
