Backbone Intensive Weekend
==========================

Over the course of one evening and two days, you will learn build a client-side, event driven web application with Backbone under the guidance of world class mentors. The focus of the weekend will be project-based application development designed to prepare you to work independently afterwards. 

Am I prepared for the weekend?
------------------------------

Intermediate to [advanced JavaScript knowledge](advanced-js.html) is assumed. You should be familiar with most jQuery APIs and understand the [MVC pattern](http://addyosmani.com/blog/understanding-mvc-and-mvp-for-javascript-and-backbone-developers/) either in concept or through using another framework.

This is also a great class for beginning Backbone users to hone their existing skills.

Course Outline
--------------

The core concepts of Backbone - views, models, collections & routers - will be explained in the context of building an application from scratch, meaning you’ll be writing code from the beginning of the course. This will include:

- Backbone's version of MVC
- How to structure your application
- Event driven architecture
- History management and Backbone.Router
- REST APIs and Backbone.sync
- Data modeling
- Templating with Handlebars.js
- Nesting views and rendering collections
- Introduction to modular development
- Testing your application
