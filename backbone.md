Backbone Intensive Weekend
==========================

Over the course of one evening and two days, you will learn build a client-side, event driven web application with Backbone under the guidance of world class mentors. The focus of the weekend will be project based application development designed to prepare you to work independently afterwards. 

Am I prepared for the weekend?

You should be familiar with most jQuery APIs and understand the [MVC pattern](http://addyosmani.com/blog/understanding-mvc-and-mvp-for-javascript-and-backbone-developers/) either in concept or through using another framework.

This is also a great class for beginning Backbone users to hone their existing skills.
