    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2>How much JavaScript do I need to know already?</h2>
    <p>While there is no formal application process to attend any of the intensives, participants will be best served if they have a base level of understanding of and experience with the JavaScript language. This includes being able to fluently use, at a minimum:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data types</li>
      <li>Conditionals</li>
      <li>Functions</li>
      <li>Objects, properties &amp; methods</li>
      <li>Iterators</li>
      <li>jQuery API for DOM manipulation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you aren't already at this level or are not sure what some of the above terms mean, we would recommend waiting to attend a ForgeJS event and starting with some of these online resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">A re-introduction to JavaScript</a>
      <li><a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript">Code School</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Can I register for all three workshops?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, email us at <a href="mailto:info@forgejs.com">info@forgejs.com</a> if you'd like to attend all three workshops. The combined rates are <b>$1550</b> for early bird registration and <b>$2000</b> for regular registration.
    </p>

    <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
    <p>In addition to your own laptop with WiFi, we'll send you a list of suggested reading and tools you'll need to have configured on your machine prior to the start of the intensive.</p>

    <h2>I'm hungry, send help!</h2>
    <p>Coffee, a light breakfast and catered lunch will be provided on Saturday and Sunday during each weekend. In addition, the HUB is located in the International District of Seattle which has a fantastic range of dining options.</p>

    <h2>Where are the events held?</h2>
    <p><a href="http://thehubseattle.com/">The HUB Seattle</a>, <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=220+2nd+Ave+South,+Seattle,+WA+98104&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x54906abb2434ea35:0x1003a6d5d2dc3a7e,220+2nd+Ave+S,+Seattle,+WA+98104&gl=us&ei=UYoqUbvDLYKeiALV_YCIDg&ved=0CDAQ8gEwAA">220 2nd Ave South, Seattle, WA 98104</a>.

    <h2>Can I transfer my registration?</h2>
    <p>You can transfer your ticket to another person by contacting <a href="mailto:info@forgejs.com">info@forgejs.com</a> and letting us know who the registration should be transferred to. Your email must match the one you bought the ticket with.</p>

    <h2>Can I cancel my registration?</h2>
    <p>Need to cancel your registration? Notify us in writing at <a href="mailto:info@forgejs.com">info@forgejs.com</a> within 15 days of the start of your workshop for a refund less a $100 fee.
