    <h1>Full Stack JavaScript Web Applications</h1>

    <p>The real-time web application is taking over. Users want to point their device to a webpage and be greeted by an interface that responds to clicks and touches immediately, with rich and expressive features and data that updates as they type and interact. JavaScript is the language that makes it all happen, but JavaScript web application development has a steep learning curve.</p>

    <p>Through a series of project based assignments and one on one mentoring we'll teach you the fundamentals that will allow you to transition from writing snippets of jQuery to writing scalable well structured applicaitons.</p>

    <p><b>Class size is limited to 24 attendees.</b></p>

    <p>The ForgeJS week long intensive covers full stack JavaScript application development through a series of projects, into which the concepts and skills listed below are integrated.</p>

    <h3>Higher Order JavaScript: Building Classes and Mastering Async</h3>
    <p>The course begins with a study of critical design patterns that enable large scale JavaScript applications. This includes scoping, binding, understanding how to treat functions as objects and how to generate new functions from within a function. Building classes and dealing with inheritence in JavaScript is one of the most challenging aspects of the language, but taking full advantage of JavaScript's prototypal nature is essential regardless of what framework you work within. Working with asynchronous code can quickly become a mind bending excercise. You'll learn how to best use jQuery's deferreds and promises, and how to asynchronously process lists with the async library.</p>

    <h3>Event Driven Architecture</h3>
    <p>Regardless of what framework or platform you work with, events are the glue that allow your code to scale. Move beyond basic DOM events with an overview of custom DOM events, and event APIs as implemented by several popular frameworks. You'll learn how and when to use your own non-DOM events to allow your objects and classes to communicate with each other.</p>

    <h3>Front end MVC with Backbone</h3>
    <p>Backbone is so widely adopted because it is a pattern for creating a complete framework for your application, rather than being an off the shelf solution. We'll teach you where Backbone is intentionally vauge, how to best fill in the gaps, and what opinions others have formed in the spaces where core Backbone has chosen to remain un-opinionated. The core concepts of Backbone - views, models, collections & routers - will be explained in the context of building an application from scratch. Backbone was initially developed to provide rich UIs for existing data rich applications, and you'll understand how to represent both ideal and less than ideal real world data APIs within Backbone.</p>

    <h3>Templating with Handlebars</h3>
    <p>Handlebars is a highly flexible templating system at the core of other frameworks, including Ember. It's also a great fit for Backbone, and we'll make sure you understand it's strengths and how to tightly couple it with your Backbone views. You'll learn how to embed DOM elements and other views within your templates and render collections, updating them as the models within them change.</p>

    <h3>Developer Skills: Workflow Automation with NPM and Grunt</h3>
    <p>Node isn't just for webservers, it's increasingly an invaluable part of managing your workflow and building your projects, even if the finished product doesn't involve Node at all. You'll learn how to spawn and control new processes from within Node and configure projects to take advantage of the thousands of available Node modules. In addition, we'll provide a plethora of use cases for Grunt and ensure you can weave together your own recipes from the hundreds of available plugins.</p>

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <p>All ForgeJS courses have a review of, and emphasis on utilizing the best practices for version control and unit testing. In addition you'll have the opportunity to collaborate with small teams on your projects if you choose, but are welcome to work on your own. <b>You are also welcome to work through your own real world projects with our mentors.</b></p>

    <h2>Am I prepared for the weekend?</h2>

    <p>It is important that you have a base level of experience with the JavaScript language, as the class will move fast to cover a lot of ground. At a minimum, this means fluency with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data types</li>
      <li>Conditionals</li>
      <li>Functions</li>
      <li>Objects, properties &amp; methods</li>
      <li>Iterators</li>
      <li>jQuery API for DOM manipulation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you aren't already at this level or are not sure what some of the above terms mean, we would recommend waiting to attend a ForgeJS event and starting with some of these online resources:</p>
