    <h2>Am I prepared for the weekend?</h2>

    <p>Intermediate to <a href="advanced-js.html">advanced JavaScript knowledge</a> is assumed. Youâ€™ll need to understand iterators, lexical scope and how to create your own objects and classes. A basic understanding of event driven architecture is a plus, but is not required.</p>

    <h2>Course Outline</h2>

    <p>The course proceeds with a series of projects into which the concepts and skills are integrated. The core topics covered are:</p>

    <h3>Building Webservers with Node</h3>
    <p>Node excels at network communication and building web servers of all types. You'll learn how to spawn HTTP requests from within node, and build both traditional webservers and pure API servers that utilize both regular SQL and NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB, etc) to power your application.</p>

    <h3>Going Realtime with Socket.io</h3>
    <p>Node was built for async and you'll learn how to take maximum advantage of it to pipe data to your applications in real time. Two way communication gets complicated in a hurry and we'll make sure you don't get lost.</p>

    <h3>Workflow Automation with NPM and Grunt</h3>
    <p>Node isn't just for webservers, it's increasingly an invaluable part of managing your workflow and building your projects, even if the finished product doesn't involve Node at all. You'll learn understand how to spawn and control new processes from within Node and can configure your project to best take advantage of the thousands of available Node modules. In addition we'll provide a plethora of use cases for Grunt and ensure you can weave together your own recipes from the hundreds of available plugins.</p>


    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <p>All ForgeJS courses have a review of, and emphasis on utilizing the best practices for version control and unit testing. In addition you'll have the opportunity to collaborate with small teams on your projects if you choose, but are welcome to work on your own. <b>You are also welcome to work through your own real world projects with our mentors.</b></p>
