hi media person, here are the summaries to be mailed out: 



ForgeJS (forgejs.com), a new Seattle based organization dedicated to teaching full stack JavaScript application development, is announcing a series of three intensive weekend workshops. Advanced JavaScript, March 22-24, is a launch pad for developers who haven't gone beyond jQuery and the DOM, covering skills, concepts and patterns foundational to building large scale JavaScript applications. Node, March 29-31, covers the foundations of backend development with Express, Connect and Socket.io, in addition to presenting an accessible first look at the Node API. Backbone, April 5-7, covers all the core concepts of client-side, event driven JavaScript web application development in the most flexible, popular JavaScript MVC library. 

Each weekend features world class mentors in an intimate setting (enrollment is limited to 24 students) and is rooted in hands on, project-based learning: you'll be coding from the minute the workshops start, with breaks for conceptual overviews and food catered onsite. All events are hosted at HUB Seattle, downtown near Pioneer Square. Early bird registration is $550 per weekend, regular registration is $700.
